Exercise 5 and 6 were straightforward. I learned what the basic syntax for a Java program was. I also switch from NetBeans to IntelliJ so I had to defamiliarize myself with the IDE.

Problem 3 was interesting. I had a hard time finding a simple pattern until I pasted the lyrics into a text editor and started tagging blocks of text that followed a pattern.

I have one official submission for Problem 3 and one alternate. The primary file (Problem3.java) should be easy to read. I created two static methods where I could identify patterns in the text.

The unofficial submission (Problem3Alt.java) was really the first way I solved the problem. The first thing I saw were the lines "She swallowed a 'animal' to catch 'anotherAnimal'. I instantly realized that I wanted to pass some argument into a method or function that printed that line. I did notice that printing only one line from a method is bad style, but it seemed so much cleaner.

The bottom line is that I'm becoming familiar with the syntax of Java. I'm definitely confused as I've done Java, perl, bash, vbscript and they're all different.

**I included MakeChange.java just in case it didn't paste onto the discussion properly.**
