/**
 * <p>Satisfies the requirements for question #4, quiz #3
 * of CS210.
 * </p>
 * <p>This program makes sure that tire pressures match by making sure front tires of a car
 * have the same pressure and same with the rear tires (but not necessarily the same pressure as the front).
 * The program reads in the pressure of the four tires and writes a message that says if the
 * pressures are good or not. The program should make sure that the input pressures
 * are within the range: 30 â€“ 40, inclusive.
